# LUDOPATIA GENERATOR v1.0
This is the source code of one of my first programs written in C.

### Download

Just download and execute the .exe file in the [releases](https://github.com/mantecados/ludopatia-generator/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page


### How does it work?

The program generates a number from (1-6)

- Press ENTER to roll a 6 face dice
- Press Q to exit

If the dice lands on the same number as the program has generated. **You win**

If it doesn't, **you lose**, but you can (must) keep playing.
